ðŸ‘‹ Hey, thanks for visiting, I'm Ben!

I'm a software engineering student currently studying at Launch School. For fun I like to lift weights, read, draw, cook... pretty much anything you can do at home!

Most of my repos are based on launch school units, here's what each one is:
- ls: JavaScript basics textbook problems

- js110: JavaScript collections practice, basically learning about arrays
- js120: Object Oriented Programming
- todoList: A small practice project using OOP
- todoList_project: An expansion on the previous project
- js130: Early exploration of testing, packaging, and asynchronus programming
- ls202: Learning and practice projects for HTML and CSS
- contacts: A small server-side rendering application using Pug, Express, Node, and PostgreSQL
- todos-js175: Little todoList site made with express and pug
- todos-pg: Next iteration of previous project using PSQL
- contacts-db: Updated version of Contacts project using PSQL
- ls215: Practice using computational thinking and problem solving. Many many problems.
- ls220: Data Structures and Algorithms (first and second passes)
